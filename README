DESCRIPTION
    Sub::Spec works using pure data structures, but sometimes it's
    convenient to have an object-oriented interface for those data. This
    module provides just that.

FUNCTIONS
  ssres $res => OBJECT
    Exported by default. A shortcut for
    Sub::Spec::Object::Response->new($res).

SEE ALSO
